# Logo Instructions

## How to Add Your School Logo

1. **Prepare your logo image:**

    - File name: `logo.jpg` (exactly this name)
    - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square format works best)
    - Format: JPG/JPEG (or you can use PNG and rename this file to logo.png)
    - Make sure it's clear and professional

2. **Add the logo:**

    - Place your `logo.jpg` file in this folder: `public/images/`
    - Replace the placeholder if one exists

3. **Logo will appear in:**

    - Welcome/Home page (80x80px)
    - Admin login page (100x100px)
    - Student login page (100x100px)
    - Sidebar navigation (60x60px)

4. **If you want to use a different format (PNG):**
    - Rename your file to `logo.jpg` OR
    - Update all references in the code from `logo.jpg` to `logo.png`
